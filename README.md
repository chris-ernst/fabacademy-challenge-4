# fabacademy-challenge-4

## Scope: 
Tati, Joaco and Chris are building a bio-based A/V interface. 

Components:

1. Button board 
2. Audio
3. Visuals
4. PCB



### Button board

Button board requires 3D modelling, molding and casting, electronics.

Material used:

### Audio

The audio interface we're working with is Ableton

### Visuals 
*more on that shortly*

### PCB

## ACADEMIC LEVEL

# Level of the project (quality and complexity of the designed prototype/code/artifacts)


# Explain how it's linked to your research areas



# Initial idea / Concept of the Project ( What questions need to be answered?)

# Propose What is supposed to do or not to do)


# Shown how your team planned and executed the project

# System diagram (illustration explaining function, parts, and relations)


# Integrated Design (How you designed it - relation between elements)

# Honest Design (use of technology in a meaningful way) Relation to the topics

# Be creative (find solutions with materials and technology you have)

# Explore design boundaries (based on your expertice)

# Listed future development opportunity for this project



# Long term dissemination plan
need to explain strategy you will use to share with future users your project (licences, tools, communication, etc)



## REPLICABILITY
