# fabacademy-challenge-4

## Scope: 
Tati, Joaco and Chris are building a bio-based A/V interface. 

Components:

1. Button board 
2. Audio
3. Visuals
4. PCB



### Button board

Button board requires 3D modelling, molding and casting, electronics.

Material used:

### Audio

The audio interface we're working with is Ableton

### Visuals 

Visuals made with Touchdesigner

### PCB

Quick notes on fabrication
- [Traces: min. 1/64IN
- 1/32IN OUTLINE
- seperation 2.55mm
- traces 0.35mm minimum
- clearance 0.4.
- holes 1mm

*more on that shortly*

All the buttons are connected to Arduino that is communicating the data to Touchdesigner. Each button triggers a visual + sound and each potentiomenter changes the color, shape and pitch.

# Long term dissemination plan
need to explain strategy you will use to share with future users your project (licences, tools, communication, etc)

Easy to scale up: we already have the 3D files for a button, potentiometer and pressure sensor, so it is only a matter of repeating the 3D printing.

As for the audiovisual files, Touchdesigner is free for personal use and has a very active community, so we could post the file on TD forums for people to use and learn. Ableton, on the other hand is very not open source and expensive, so it wouldn't be easy to share that with people who do not have a license for it.





## ACADEMIC LEVEL

# Level of the project (quality and complexity of the designed prototype/code/artifacts)


# Explain how it's linked to your research areas



# Initial idea / Concept of the Project ( What questions need to be answered?)

# Propose What is supposed to do or not to do)


# Shown how your team planned and executed the project

# System diagram (illustration explaining function, parts, and relations)


# Integrated Design (How you designed it - relation between elements)

# Honest Design (use of technology in a meaningful way) Relation to the topics

# Be creative (find solutions with materials and technology you have)

# Explore design boundaries (based on your expertice)

# Listed future development opportunity for this project



# Long term dissemination plan
need to explain strategy you will use to share with future users your project (licences, tools, communication, etc)



## REPLICABILITY

# Level of clarity and detail of the documentation material (photos, video, text, etc)

# How did you fabricate it (fabrication processes and materials)

# Design & Fabrication files (open source or open format)

# BOM (Build of Materials)

# Iteration Process (spiral development)

# Described problems and how the team solved them

# Photographies of the end artifacts



## ATTITUDE

# Involvement, Motivation level proactive behaviors

# Attendance to classes

# Proactive behaviours to find answers during the challenge

# Help others student's projects


# Participation in feedbacks sessions

# Dealing with uncertainty

# Don't be afraid to make mistakes ( going out of your confort zone)
