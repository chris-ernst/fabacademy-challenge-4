# Hybrid Ecosystems

## Building a bio-based MIDI controller for an interactive audiovisual performance

# SCOPE
Tati, Joaco and Chris are building a bio-based A/V interface. 

Components:

1. Button board 
2. PCB
3. Audio & Visuals

In this documentation we will focus on the fabrication of the controller and the electronics as this was the main focus this week. 

## Button board

Button board requires 3D modelling, molding and casting, electronics.

Material used:

- 3 buttons
- 3 potentiometers
- 1 touch sensor
- biomaterials
- 3D materials for printing models for moulding and casting
- 3D materials for printing the box
- cables
- screws
- Arduino board

All the buttons are connected to Arduino that is communicating the data to Touchdesigner. Each button triggers a visual + sound and each potentiomenter changes the color, shape and pitch.

### Milling and Soldering an Arduino Shield

Designing, milling and soldering a Arduino Shield to multiply the GND and 5V outputs for the controller. 

Some notes on fabrication
- Trace mill: min. 1/64"
- Outline mill: 1/32"
- Trace seperation: 2.55mm
- Minimal trace width: 0.35mm 
- Trace clearance: 0.4mm
- Hole diameter: 1mm

PCB files can be found [here](/1_fabrication/Arduino_Shield).

# ACADEMIC LEVEL

## Long term dissemination plan
need to explain strategy you will use to share with future users your project (licences, tools, communication, etc)

Easy to scale up: we already have the 3D files for a button, potentiometer and pressure sensor, so it is only a matter of repeating the 3D printing.

As for the audiovisual files, Touchdesigner is free for personal use and has a very active community, so we could post the file on TD forums for people to use and learn. Ableton, on the other hand is very not open source and expensive, so it wouldn't be easy to share that with people who do not have a license for it.

- [ ] Level of the project (quality and complexity of the designed prototype/code/artifacts)

- [ ] Explain how it's linked to your research areas

- [ ] Initial idea / Concept of the Project ( What questions need to be answered?)

- [ ] Propose What is supposed to do or not to do)


- [ ] Shown how your team planned and executed the project
